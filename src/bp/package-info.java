/**
 * This package provides the business logic 
 * for an A-Star search algorithm on a grid.  
 * 
 * Contains the following files:
 * 1) AbstractMaze.java - The supporting functions 
 *      for implementing a maze search.
 * 2) PotentialPath.java - This is handy for saving potential 
 *      paths under consideration. It implements the Comparable 
 *      interface, so you can call the sort(null) function 
 *      against it to sort upward the least cost potential path.
 *      
 * For the lab, create a class, Maze, that extends AbstractMaze
 * and implements the getAStarPath() algorithm.  
 * You may leverage all supporting functions in AbstractMaze to help you.
