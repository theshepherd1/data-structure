#Data Structure
Hi there! This is the code I wrote during my data structure class of my junior year in college. I put each different class session / topic on a different branch. I try to make the 'develop' branch the comprehensive one so you don't have to pull down different branches when trying to refer to something.

This repo is for implementation reference of basic data structures such as binary trees and graphs. Most of the classes also have functionalities of insertion and deletion. I hope this can help you out whether you are learning data structures, or are just a little rusty and a little refresh on these topics. :)
